## 🧩 Features

### ✅ DSA Tracker
Track your daily LeetCode grind, from Easy wins to Medium meltdowns. Logs your questions, tracks progress, and helps you feel productive even when you're sobbing over Dynamic Programming.

### 👨‍💻 Development Tracker
Mark bugs, commits, and project milestones. Yes, even the ones that took 5 hours and 7 Stack Overflow tabs to solve.

### 🧠 System Design Tracker
Empty by default. Because let’s face it – we all say we’ll start System Design “tomorrow.”

### 🕵️ Job Search Tracker
Manage applications, track follow-ups, and note down the 5th recruiter who said “We’ll get back to you.”

### 🤖 AI Assistant
Upload your notes or PDFs and let the AI do the reading, summarizing, and pretending-you-studied for you – powered by LangChain & OpenAI APIs.
